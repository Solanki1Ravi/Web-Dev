What is Specificity?
    If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.



Specificity Hierarchy:=

-->Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

    There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:
    1.Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">

    2.IDs - Example: #navbar

    3.Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]

    4.Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, ::before 


1. 0 for universal selector , 

2. add 100 for each ID value, 

3. add 10 for each class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector),

4. add 1 for each element selector or pseudo-element.

5. 1000 for inline style

6. 10000 for !important


A.The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

B.In fact, if we use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!
